I feel that all four projects are equally hard in the sense that they all require a lot of time to go through the codes and understand what pintos is doing. Once understood, the coding bit is not hard, but time consuming, so please be prepared to devote plenty of time. Though it is recommended to do the designdocs before starting the projects, I find it hard to start with only the docs. My suggested steps are: read the code -> wrtie a few lines of codes or comments(preferably design your structs and global vars) -> write the docs -> finish your code. 

About syncronization: 
For me, syncronization is the hard task in each project, but as this is a small project and sometimes you get away with poorly designed syncronizations easily. I think it is okay if all you want to achieve is basic understanding of perating systems, but if you are ambitious in related fields, you should take your time to consider it. 

About referenceing and consulting others code:
This project is not easy, it is okay to reference and consult others' code. Just DON'T COPY!
